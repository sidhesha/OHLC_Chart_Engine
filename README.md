<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Demo_Image](./image.jpeg)

In this project we create a Dashboard based on which User would be able to analyze the sentiment of the specific stock. We can create an Analytical Server "OHLC" (Open/High/Low/Close) time series based on the ‘Stock List’.

The special features are:

1. User can have the ability to search the different stocks based on the symbols and view the chart.
2. Users can filter the stock’s performance on specific date range
3. Users can view the history of their searches.
4. Users can switch between OHLC, Candlestick charts, Colored Bar, Vertex Line and Hollow Candle.
5. User can see additional information about selected company. You can use this free resource to get company information by ticker symbol or use any other free API available on internet
